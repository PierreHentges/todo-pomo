 
A Python script trying to combine [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) with the [Pomodoro method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). The plan is to eventually run it as a Flask app on my NAS and visualise the pomodoro stats.
Uses the [Todo.txt I/O](https://github.com/EpocDotFr/todotxtio) module and uses several functions from the [command line pomodoro app](https://github.com/mehdidc/pomodoro).
